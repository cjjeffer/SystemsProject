## About

This project is a program that uses takes recent tweets from Twitter about a particular movie and feeds those tweets to a sentiment analysis API. The sentiment analysis API determines which of the tweets are negative and positive and based on the ratio it gives the movie in question a review score. 

Made in Unity, as such I am legally unable to share all of the code I used such as 3rd party tools that allow the program to run, but I have my scripts I wrote to interface with these APIS in the src/Code folder.
